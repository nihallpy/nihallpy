# Hi there, I'm Nihal!

I'm an **intermediate-level programmer** who's still learning and growing.  
I mainly work with **Python** and **Java**, and I'm always experimenting with new ideas.

## What to expect:
- Basic to moderately complex scripts and programs  
- Clean code (mostly)  
- A few bugs here and there (I'm learning, okay?)

## What *not* to expect:
- Perfect, production-ready code  
- Super advanced algorithms (yet!)  
- Daily updates (life happens)

## About me:
- I code for fun and learning
- I prefer practical projects over theory
- I believe in improving one step at a time

Thanks for stopping by â€” feel free to explore, suggest improvements, or just say hi!
